This is a Linux terminal. There are a few useful commands that will make live easier.

## File commands

You will start in your *home directory*. This is were you can store your files. Let's have a look:

```bash
ls
```

shows you all your files. At the moment there are none. So lets create a directory:

```bash
mkdir dft
```

This will create a new subfolder called `dft`. This is were we will work. Let's change to this directory:

```bash
cd dft
```

Note that the prompt has changed. It always gives you an indication where you are. If you get lost

```bash
cd $HOME
```

will bring you right back to your home directory.

We will come across a few more useful commands as we go along.
