# Login

To the right, you see the work area, which at the moment shows a command prompt. If the work area is not shown or disappears at some point, just reload the page (a few times if needed).

> Every time you come back to the web page, you can just login and continue where you have left off. Your work will be waiting for you. If you want to start from scratch again, just delete all files in your home folder. We will explain how this works shortly.

Make sure that you are logged in as *youself*. You can check your username with

```bash
whoami
```

Your username should be equal to your Github account name. Check it now.
