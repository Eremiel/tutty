# Getting material

You should be back in the command prompt. You should see your login name and the directory where you are to the left of the cursor.

Let's get some material to work with. We will use `git`, a version control software for this. Type

```bash
git clone https://git.soton.ac.uk/CHEM6136/exercises.git
```

What just happened? `git` fetched some pre-made files for us by checking out a repository from the universities version control system. Version control a great way to keep track of changes to text files etc. You are welcome to learn more about it. But not right now.

You have a new directory called `exercises`. Check it:

```bash
ls
```
